Great Real Estate provides functionality to turn your WordPress installation into a content managed real estate website.

== Description ==

Great Real Estate was developed to enable real estate agents, brokers, and REALTORS to display and manage information about their listings in WordPress pages.

The property information and listing templates allow for consistent display of the property listings across the site. Authors do not need to format the content, they simply enter it into a form.

Widgets and custom page templates permit display of only available homes, only sold homes, a random "featured" home, and a detailed property page for a listing.

This plugin works best if you also use the following plugins:
* NextGen Gallery - to upload, manage, and display property listing photos
* WordTube - to upload, manage, and display videos
* FPP Pano - to display panorama photos in a Flash 360 degree interface ("virtual tours")
* Feed Wrangler - to enable you to send a listings feed to various websites, such as Googe Base, Trulia, and Zillow
* WP-DownloadManager - to display and track links to downloadable brochures

You'll also need to get a Google API key to enable the maps display, and a Truilia, Google Base, and Zillow account to enable feeds.

To use the panorama plugin, you'll need to obtain the Flash Panorama Player, appropriately licensed for your domain.
